## Install

You can download the installer [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/).

Run the installer and select to install it only for you, or all users.

## Connection &amp; first run

On the first start, we can select the connection type to our Azure Storage.

## Access to local emulator

If we have configured the [local emulator](https://blog.rodrigojuarez.com/2020/12/03/azure-storage-emulator-for-development-in-windows-10/) (Azurite), we can connect using the *Open Connect Dialog* icon.
