When Iâ€™m debugging applications, I usually need to check some JSON responses.

If you only want to see the formatted JSON, you can use [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) with PowerShell (BTW I installed jq [using chocolatey](https://dev.to/codingcoach/chocolatey-a-better-way-to-install-software-on-windows-ljo)), running the following PowerShell command in your terminal:

```
<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">get-clipboard|jq
```

To do that, I can create a PowerShell script with the following snippet and save it in a folder included in my path and then call it from a PowerShell prompt after copying the JSON to the clipboard.

```
<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">$clipboardFile = "$env:TEMP\clipboard.json"
get-clipboard > $clipboardFile|code $clipboardFile
```

For example, I created the file jtoc.ps1 in my c:\\windows folder, and I can copy the following JSON to the clipboard `{"Hello":"json formatter","Using":"vs code"}` and then use `jtoc` in the terminal and it will open in vs code, then I use ALT+SHIFT+F to format the text.
