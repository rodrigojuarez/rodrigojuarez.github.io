## Install

You can download the installer [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/).

Run the installer and select to install it only for you, or all users.

![](/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-9.png?resize=362%2C271&ssl=1)Then complete the installation with the default values.

## Connection &amp; first run

On the first start, we can select the connection type to our Azure Storage.

## Access to local emulator

If we have configured the [local emulator](2020/12/03/azure-storage-emulator-for-development-in-windows-10/) (Azurite), we can connect using the *Open Connect Dialog* icon.

![](/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-13.png?resize=611%2C618&ssl=1)I have my Azurite instance configured with the default values, so I can connect just setting any Display name.

![](/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-14.png?resize=611%2C618&ssl=1)After confirmation, we can access our local Azurite in the same way that we can access our Azure storage (remember to run your local emulator).
