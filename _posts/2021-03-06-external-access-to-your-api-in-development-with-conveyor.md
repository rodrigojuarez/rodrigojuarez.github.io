In my usual workflow, when Iâ€™m developing an API with Visual Studio, and I need to access it from a mobile app, I publish the API to Azure or a local IIS server.  
I need to do this because, by default, IIS express publish your API with the localhost endpoint, and it canâ€™t be easily used outside the running machine.  
I was looking for a quick fix when I found [Conveyor, a Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-1448185.ConveyorbyKeyoti) that automatically provides our APIâ€™s external access. Additionally, I created an account on their website to enable public access to my API (outside of the local network).  
After installing the extension, it would start when I run my project in Debug mode.  
In the following screenshot, you can see which ones are the enabled endpoints.

We can also enable the use of certificates for HTTPS access.  
A great addition to my toolbox, easy to install and use ðŸ˜‰
